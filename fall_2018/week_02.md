## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Created a wireframe for the website, so that we have a plan to follow as we implement the website. Shared it with the slack channel so that everyone else is up to date on what we will be doing with the website, we should also be able to get some feedback once people have looked at it.

## This Week's Plan

> This week we should start working with Django, and potentially creating a basic website with the four main pages specified in the wireframe.
> Still not great at Django, probably going to have to lookup some tutorials on how that all works. 
> Potentially create a more organized presentation of the wireframe on google slides.

## Anything Blocking?

> For right now, the website portion of Hedgehogs is going pretty smoothly.
