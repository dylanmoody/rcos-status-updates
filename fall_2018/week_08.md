## Last Week's Accomplishments

Made some progress with Morgan on the front-end.
Main portion of time that I spent over the last week was on the presentation that will 
happen on Friday. The practice presentation that we did seemed to go well, maybe it was
a bit long, but we are a pretty large group so hopefully that is ok.

## This Week's Plan

Polish the frontend with Morgan, and link it up with the git repo.
Create a new repo so that we are not commiting directly to the master, I will 
retroactively add the new repo in notes after we are done this week.

## Anything Blocking?

> No not really.

## Notes
