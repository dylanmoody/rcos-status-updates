## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over the last week I started working on the frontend pages that will eventually be used in the
django server. Unfortunately there was a bit of a miscommunication and somebody else had also started 
creating pages that are now already linked in with the Django site.

## This Week's Plan

> Migrate the parts that we want to keep from what we made to the new files that are in django, then 
continue work on the body of the webpages.
> Create a new branch where we can make commits without messing up anything, not sure what we will do
with the old frontend branch.


## Anything Blocking?

> No not really.

## Notes
