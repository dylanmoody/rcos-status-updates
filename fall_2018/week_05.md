## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Over the last week I went through and did a bit of a restructure of the directory that contains
static and template files for the website
> I also got the templates working and linked the homepage to the static files so that the css
can be easily done through the static files

## This Week's Plan

> I plan on getting the bar at the top working, using the template of course, that way I can
distribute it to all of the pages that get added to the site

## Anything Blocking?

> The website is sort of on its own right now, in that it doesnt really rely on any of the other parts 
of the project for progress to be made.
