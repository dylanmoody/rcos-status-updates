## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week we worked on our presentation, and made some touch ups to the frontend.
I presented on the wireframe and how we translated it into the final project.
A lot of the time during the semester where I was not commiting I was looking through
documentation and trying to figure out how to integrate into the django backend that had 
already been created. 

## This Week's Plan

Study for finals

## Anything Blocking?

We have managed to accomplish our goals for the semester!

## Notes

> I am just going to link every branch that I have worked on up to now for convenience. 
It should be noted that some of the commmits that I made to a few of these branches have never and
most likely will never see any use. However I used the them as learning experiences and 
they helped me make progress on the final product.
