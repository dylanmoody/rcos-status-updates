## Last Week's Accomplishments

> Unfortunately I was not able to work on this project too much over the last week.

## This Week's Plan

> I have a decent amount of free time this weekend, I should be able to get the landing page working.

## Anything Blocking?

> The website is sort of on its own right now, in that it doesnt really rely on any of the other parts 
of the project for progress to be made. 

## Notes

> Realized that I forgot to add the link to the presentation to last weeks update notes,
went back and added that retroactively (hopefully that is ok).
