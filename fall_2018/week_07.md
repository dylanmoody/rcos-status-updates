## Last Week's Accomplishments

Made the following commit to the site
- Changed base_layout to be more in line with the wireframe, some changes had to be accomodated as a search 
bar was not present in the wireframe.
- Added footer
- Fixed links that did not appear
- cleaned up base_layout html to make it more readable
- fixed link to login page, added text to it so we can be sure it works now
- removed dropdown as it didnt really seem to serve much of a point

I was also working on adding the graph to the tools page, but today I learned that 
somebody already did that. So I guess I don't need to do that anymore.

## This Week's Plan

> Continue work on the frontend, add content to the pages that need it

## Anything Blocking?

> No not really.

## Notes

> I just started making changes directly to the master now:
